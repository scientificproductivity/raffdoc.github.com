Title is very simple
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example: thsi is good example

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```


```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars,col="blue")
abline(lm(cars$dist~cars$speed),col="red")
```



```{r }
library(likert)
data(pisana)
items <- pisana[,c(
  'ST24Q01', #Only if I have to
	'ST24Q02', #Favourite hobbies
	'ST24Q03', #Talk about books
	'ST24Q04', #Hard to finish
	'ST24Q05', #Happy as present
	'ST24Q06', #Waste of time
	'ST24Q07', #Enjoy library
	'ST24Q08', #Need information
	'ST24Q09', #Cannot sit still
	'ST24Q10', #Express opinions
	'ST24Q11'  #Exchange
	)]
names(items) <- c("I read only if I have to.",
		"Reading is one of my favorite hobbies.",
		"I like talking about books with other people.",
		"I find it hard to finish books.",
		"I feel happy if I receive a book as a present.",
		"For me, reading is a waste of time.",
		"I enjoy going to a bookstore or a library.",
		"I read only to get information that I need.",
		"I cannot sit still and read for more than a few minutes.",
		"I like to express my opinions about books I have read.",
		"I like to exchange books with my friends")
for(i in 1:ncol(items)) {
	items[,i] <-  factor(items[,i], levels=c(1,2,3,4), ordered=TRUE,
		labels=c('Strongly Disagree', 'Disagree', 'Agree', 'Strongly Agree'))
}
l <- likert(items, grouping=pisana$CNT)
```
Plot the results.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
plot(l, centered = TRUE)
```



```{r }
options(width = 120)
summary(l)
```
